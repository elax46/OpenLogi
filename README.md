> **Options+ ? Try OpenLogi.**

Remap buttons, drive DPI and SmartShift, and switch profiles per app — without a
Logitech account, telemetry, or the official Options+ install. No cloud, plain
TOML config; the only network calls are device-image fetches and an opt-in,
off-by-default update check.

---

## What it is

OpenLogi talks to Logitech HID++ mice over a Logi Bolt receiver — or a
Bluetooth-direct / wired connection — without running Logi Options+. It ships
two binaries:

- **`openlogi-gui`** — a GPUI desktop app: an interactive mouse diagram with
  clickable hotspots, a per-button action picker (37 built-in actions plus
  recorded custom shortcuts), DPI presets, a SmartShift toggle, per-application
  profile overlays, and a device carousel that switches between paired devices
  live.
- **`openlogi`** — a CLI for headless inventory (`list`) plus asset-sync and
  on-device diagnostic subcommands.

Everything is local: bindings live in a plain TOML file, button presses are
remapped through the OS event tap, and DPI / SmartShift changes are written
straight to the device over HID++.

macOS is the supported platform today. Linux and Windows compile (HID
enumeration works), but the OS-level event hook is a stub — see
[Status](#status).

## What it is not

- **Not a headless daemon.** The remapping hook runs inside `openlogi-gui`
  while it's open (optionally launched at login). There is no separate
  background service.
- **Not a cloud or telemetry app.** No account, no telemetry, no auto-download.
  The only outbound traffic is (1) fetching your device's render image from
  `assets.openlogi.org` on first launch — avoidable entirely with a
  bundled-assets build — and (2) an **opt-in** update check, off by default,
  that makes a single HEAD request to the GitHub releases API and never
  downloads anything.
- **Not a drop-in for Options+ — yet.** Scroll-wheel rotation binding,
  gesture-button swipe *hardware* capture, scroll inversion, and Logitech Flow
  are not implemented. Side-button remapping, DPI, SmartShift, and per-app
  profiles are. See [Status](#status).
- **Not affiliated with Logitech.** "Logitech", "MX Master", and "Options+" are
  trademarks of Logitech International S.A.

## Status

Pre-alpha, macOS-first. The workspace builds on Linux and Windows (CI keeps them
green), but the interactive features below require the macOS event tap.

| Capability | State |
|---|---|
| Discover Bolt receivers + list paired devices (CLI + GUI) | ✅ |
| Bluetooth-direct / wired devices (no receiver) | ✅ |
| Battery percentage / charge state | ✅ (online devices) |
| Interactive GUI: carousel, mouse diagram, action picker | ✅ macOS |
| Button remapping via the OS event tap (side Back / Forward today) | ✅ macOS |
| 37-action catalog + recorded custom keyboard shortcuts | ✅ macOS¹ |
| DPI control + presets + Cycle / Set-preset actions (HID++ `0x2201`) | ✅ macOS |
| SmartShift wheel-mode toggle (HID++ `0x2111`) | ✅ macOS |
| Per-application profile overlays (auto-switch on app focus) | ✅ macOS |
| Launch-at-login + opt-in update check | ✅ (TOML only — no settings UI yet) |
| Gesture-button per-direction bindings | 🟡 configurable; hardware capture pending |
| Middle / mode-shift / thumbwheel button capture | 🟡 configurable; hook owns side buttons only |
| Linux / Windows event hook | ❌ stub (`Unsupported`) |
| Unifying receivers | ❌ (not yet in `hidpp 0.2`) |

¹ A few actions (e.g. the media keys) currently log their intended event rather
than posting it — tracked as a follow-up.

## Install

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Quit **Logi Options+** first — the two applications fight over HID++ access and only one can own a given receiver at a time.

Download the signed, notarized `.dmg` from the
[latest release](https://github.com/AprilNEA/OpenLogi/releases/latest) and drag
`OpenLogi.app` to `/Applications`.

Or install via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```sh
brew install --cask aprilnea/tap/openlogi
```

To build from source, see [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Usage (CLI)

```sh
openlogi list                 # paired devices: slot, codename, kind, online, battery
openlogi assets sync          # pre-fetch device renders from assets.openlogi.org
openlogi diag features        # dump every HID++ feature the active device reports
openlogi diag dpi             # read → write → read-back → restore DPI (smoke test)
openlogi diag smartshift      # toggle SmartShift and restore (smoke test)
```

Running `openlogi` with no subcommand defaults to `list`. Set
`OPENLOGI_LOG=debug` for verbose tracing on either binary.
